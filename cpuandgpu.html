              <h1> CPU</h1> <br>
              <p>The CPU is considered one of the most important components of a computer. The CPU is literally the "brain" of the operation.
               It decodes and processes all that the computer does. It runs processing requests,  answers to all problem and task needs,
                and runs computer everything from games to web browsers to software. When an persons needs to input a command using a mouse or keyboard,
                 the CPU literally decodes the intended meaning within milliseconds to do the command that was requested
                 The CPU communicates with other hardware components like the RAM and graphics card to make sure everything is operating. A computer cannot function without its CPU.</p> <br>

                 <h2>GPU</h2>
                 <p>A GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a piece of computer hardware that generates images, video,
                  and animation for viewing and is designed for smaller tasks, making it more effective than a CPU when it comes to bigger tasks.
                  The GPU was created for high-level gaming and high-level graphics .
                   However, over time, the GPU has been used for real-time rendering changes, like video editing and 3D graphic creation. 
                   Also, GPUs are used for artificial intelligence to render processing and to solve future problems more quickly.</p>
