            <h1>Medium end Pc</h1> <br>
            <p> If you are looking for a mid end computer/pc then i would look at a laptop or a gaming laptop, its because they are not bad but at the sametime they are not good.<br>
            So it would be right to put laptops or gaming laptopd in the Mid End PC spot. Honestly i would save up more money to get a pc thats better than a gaming laptop,<br>
            I have a gaming laptop and its good but there are some bad things about it like the battery life when its not plugged in into power, it will probably only stay on for 2 hours then die<br>
            So its up to you to chose, if you are buying here are some parts of it <br>
            AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS Processor<br>
            GeForce RTX 2050,<br>
            8GB RAM<br>
            Window 11<br>

            The price of this Gaming Laptop is $949.00, 
            it is because of the graphics card the low end pc doesnt have it so thats why its cheap and not good but this is better then that but i would save up.</p>
