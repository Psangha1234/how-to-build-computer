         <h1>Basic Parts</h1>
        <p> Some people think there's lots of parts in a pc but really there aren't that many, here i will talk about the basic parts of a computer.
          CPU (Processor)—the component that allows for processing and operation as it is the computer's brains for all functioning.  Motherboard- The motherboard is the main part of the computer that connects all other components.
          It sends and receives data between them, acting as a central hub for information. RAM (Memory)—used for temporary access so that quicker processing and programs are available.  Hard/Optical Drive—hard drive is for saved storage of photos and documents;  optical drive is for playing/running games and movies.
            Power Supply—provides power to the computer.
            System Fan/Heat Sink—keeps the system cool so that it does not overheat, this is usally a problem with gameing laptops because they are so small and have all these parts in them and sometimes
             it can't take it so it needs something to cool it down. That was the basic of a Pc and i hope this helps you out on make a computer. </p>
